## Part 1: TrailShop Project Task

### Task 1: Set Up PostgreSQL

Goal: install a working PostgreSQL server on your computer and confirm you can start `psql` (or an equivalent client).

---

### Local installation

**Step 1 — Download the installer**

1. Open [https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).
2. Click **Download the installer** (EDB installer is fine).
3. Choose a recent stable version (e.g. 16 or 17) for **Windows x86-64**.
4. Save the `.exe` file and run it.

_(macOS / Linux: start from [https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and follow the OS-specific guide.)_

**Step 2 — Run the setup wizard**

Work through the wizard. Suggested choices for this course:

1. **Installation directory** — leave the default.
2. **Select components** — keep at least **PostgreSQL Server**, **pgAdmin 4**, **Command Line Tools**, and **Stack Builder** (Stack Builder can be skipped later).
3. **Data directory** — leave the default.
4. **Password** — set a password for the superuser account `postgres`.
   **Write it down.** You will need it every time you connect.
5. **Port** — leave **5432** (default) unless that port is already in use.
6. **Locale** — leave the default.
7. Finish the install. You can decline launching Stack Builder if prompted.

**Step 3 — Confirm the service is running (Windows)**

1. Press `Win`, type **Services**, open **Services**.
2. Find a service named like `postgresql-x64-16` (version number may differ).
3. Status should be **Running**. If not, right-click → **Start**.

**Step 4 — Open a terminal where** `psql` **is available**

On Windows, the easiest reliable options are:

- **Option 4a:** Start Menu → **SQL Shell (psql)** (installed with PostgreSQL), **or**
- **Option 4b:** Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt**.

If `psql` is not found in PowerShell, either use **SQL Shell (psql)** or add the PostgreSQL `bin` folder to your PATH, for example:

```
C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin
```

(Adjust `16` to match your installed version.)

**Step 5 — Verify the installation**

In PowerShell / Command Prompt, run:

```
psql --version
```

You should see something like `psql (PostgreSQL) 16.x`.

If you used **SQL Shell (psql)** instead, you can skip `--version` and go straight to connecting in Task 2 — successful connection also proves the install works.

**Step 6 — Capture evidence for submission**

Take a screenshot of `psql --version` output (or of a successful `psql` connection prompt).

---

### Task 2: Create the TrailShop Database

Goal: create an empty database named `trailshop` and confirm you are connected to it.

Complete these steps after Task 1 succeeds.

**Step 1 — Connect to the PostgreSQL server as** `postgres`

**If you use SQL Shell (psql) on Windows**, press Enter to accept defaults for Server, Database, Port, and Username (`postgres`), then type the password you set during install when prompted.

**If you use PowerShell / Command Prompt**, run:

```
psql -U postgres -h localhost -p 5432
```

Enter the `postgres` password when asked.

You should see a prompt similar to:

```
postgres=#
```

That means you are connected to the default `postgres` maintenance database — which is normal before creating `trailshop`.

**Step 2 — List existing databases (optional but useful)**

At the `postgres=#` prompt, run:

```
\l
```

Scan the list. If `trailshop` already exists from an earlier attempt, skip Step 3 and go to Step 4.

**Step 3 — Create the database**

Still at the `postgres=#` prompt, run exactly:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE trailshop;
```

Expected result:

```
CREATE DATABASE
```

If you see `ERROR: database "trailshop" already exists`, the database is already there — continue to Step 4.

**Step 4 — Connect to** `trailshop`

In `psql`, run:

```
\c trailshop
```

Expected result (wording may vary slightly):

```
You are now connected to database "trailshop" as user "postgres".
```

**Step 5 — Confirm the prompt and that the database is empty**

1. Check that your prompt shows `trailshop`, for example:

```
trailshop=#
```

1. List tables:

```
\dt
```

You should see **no tables** (or a message that no relations were found). That is expected in Week 36 — tables come later.

1. Confirm the current database name with SQL:

```sql
SELECT current_database();
```

Expected: one row with `trailshop`.

**Step 6 — Quit psql (when finished)**

```
\q
```

**Step 7 — Capture evidence for submission**

Take a screenshot showing:

- successful `\c trailshop` (or the `trailshop=#` prompt), **and**
- `\dt` with an empty result / “Did not find any relations”

### Troubleshooting (Tasks 1–2)

| Problem                                | What to try                                                                                                                  |

### Task 3: Reflection Worksheet

Answer the following in your own words (write 2–3 sentences per point):

1. List **3 specific problems** TrailShop would face if they kept using spreadsheets as their product catalog grows to 5,000+ items with 10 staff members.

> [!NOTE]
> ***Your Answer***
>
> -Data inconsistency: With 10 people editing, the same item can end up with different names, prices, or stock counts across copies. There's no enforced single source of truth.
  -Concurrency problems: Spreadsheets don't handle simultaneous edits well. If two staff update the same item's stock at once, one person's change can silently overwrite the other's with no warning.
  -Poor scalability: At 5,000+ rows, spreadsheets get slow to search and filter. Complex queries like "items under $20 with stock below 5" become manual, error-prone, and slow.

2. List **3 benefits** of switching to a database system, explaining how each one solves a problem from your list above.

> [!NOTE]
> ***Your Answer***
>
> Centralized data with constraints fixes inconsistency. each item is stored once, and constraints prevent duplicate or malformed entries. Everyone works from the same authoritative record.
Transactions and concurrency control fix the overwrite problem. the DBMS ensures simultaneous updates are handled safely instead of one silently erasing the other. This keeps stock counts and prices accurate even with many editors.
Indexing and SQL queries fix scalability. indexes let queries return instantly even with tens of thousands of rows. Staff can filter precisely instead of manually scrolling a huge spreadsheet.

3. Explain the three-schema architecture in your own words. Why is the separation into three levels useful?

> [!NOTE]
> ***Your Answer***
>
> The three-schema architecture splits a database into three levels: the internal schema (how data is physically stored on disk), the conceptual schema (the logical structure — tables, columns, relationships), and the external schema (the tailored view each user or app sees). we can change physical storage or add a new column at the logical level without breaking applications or user views built on top. It keeps changes at one level from rippling through and breaking the others.

## Part 2: Theory Review Questions

Answer each question in 2–4 sentences. Reference the Theory material sections as needed.

### Short-Answer Questions

**Q1.** What is the difference between data and information? Give a concrete example using TrailShop data.
_(See Section 1 of this week's Theory material.)_

> [!NOTE]
> ***Your Answer***
>
> Data is raw, context-free facts, like "189.50" and "42" alone. Information is data with context that makes it meaningful. "Alpine Pro Hiking Boots costs €189.50, 42 in stock." TrailShop has lots of data but struggles to turn it into usable information.

**Q2.** List and explain three disadvantages of file-based data management systems. For each, describe how it would affect TrailShop specifically.
_(See Section 2 of this week's Theory material.)_

> [!NOTE]
>
>
> Inconsistency: the same product has different prices across files, so customers get charged wrong.
> Isolation: customer, order, and category data live in separate formats, making simple questions take hours to answer.
> Concurrency issues: two staff editing the same spreadsheet at once causes one person's changes to overwrite the other's.

**Q3.** What is a DBMS? List four of its core functions.
_(See Sections 3 and 4 of this week's Theory material.)_

> [!NOTE]
> ***Your Answer***
>
> A DBMS is software that creates, maintains, and controls access to a database, sitting between applications and stored data. Core functions include data definition (DDL), data manipulation (DML), concurrency control, and security/authorization.

**Q4.** Explain program-data independence with a concrete example. Why is it important?
_(See Section 5.2 of this week's Theory material.)_

> [!NOTE]
> ***Your Answer***
>
>Program-data independence means applications aren't tied to the data's structure, so schema changes don't break them. E.g., adding a weight_kg column to products doesn't break a query that only selects name, price. This keeps maintenance cheap and low-risk.

**Q5.** What is metadata? Give two examples of metadata for a `products` table.
_(See Section 8 of this week's Theory material.)_

> [!NOTE]
> ***Your Answer***
>
> Metadata is "data about data" — it describes structure, not content. Examples: price has type NUMERIC(10,2); the constraint price > 0.

**Q6.** What is the three-schema architecture? Name and briefly describe each level.
_(See Section 3.3 of this week's Theory material.)_

> [!NOTE]
> ***Your Answer***
>
> It splits a database into three levels: external (what each user/app sees, e.g. marketing vs. warehouse views), conceptual (the full logical structure tables, columns, relationships), and internal (how data is physically stored on disk).

**Q7.** Explain the difference between logical data independence and physical data independence.
_(See Section 3.4 of this week's Theory material.)_

> [!NOTE]
> ***Your Answer***
>
>Logical independence lets you change the conceptual schema (e.g., add a column) without affecting apps that don't use it. Physical independence lets you change physical storage (e.g., add an index) without touching the logical structure or apps.

**Q8.** What is a transaction? Why is atomicity important? Give a TrailShop example.
_(See Section 5.5 of this week's Theory material.)_

> [!NOTE]
> ***Your Answer***
>
>A transaction is a unit of work that must fully complete or not happen at all (atomicity). This prevents half-finished, inconsistent states. Example: if a TrailShop order's payment fails, the whole transaction rolls back so stock isn't decremented for an order that never completed.

### True/False

For each statement, write **True** or **False** and correct any false statements.

1. A DBMS stores only data, not information about the data's structure.
2. In a file-based system, changing the format of a data file requires updating every program that reads it.
3. Data redundancy means the same data is stored in multiple places.
4. PostgreSQL is a commercial, closed-source database system.
5. The conceptual level of the three-schema architecture describes how data is physically stored on disk.

> [!NOTE]
> ***Your Answer***
>
> False. A DBMS is self-describing — it stores both the data and metadata (the data dictionary/system catalog) describing its own structure.
> True.
> True.
> False. PostgreSQL is free and open-source, not commercial or closed-source.
> False. That describes the internal level. The conceptual level describes the full logical structure of the database — tables, columns, relationships, and constraints — independent of physical storage.

## Part 3: Practical Exercises

These exercises require a working PostgreSQL installation. See Part 1, Task 1 if you haven't set it up yet.

### Exercise 3.1: Explore psql

Connect to PostgreSQL using psql and complete the following. Write down the command you used and the output (or a summary of it).

1. List all databases on your server.
2. Connect to the `trailshop` database.
3. List all tables in the `trailshop` database.
4. Use `\?` to display the list of psql meta-commands. Find and write down the commands for:

- Describing a specific table's structure
- Listing all users/roles
- Showing help for a specific SQL command

5. Quit psql.

> [!NOTE]
> ***Your Answer***
>
> _(Document the commands you used and summarize the output for each step.)_

### Exercise 3.2: Explore the System Catalog

While connected to `trailshop`, run the following queries and write down what they return:

```sql
SELECT current_database();
```

```sql
SELECT version();
```

```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
```

Why does the last query return no rows? What would you expect to see after creating tables in future weeks?

> [!NOTE]
> ***Your Answer***
>
> _(Write your answer here.)_

### Exercise 3.3: Create and Drop a Test Database

Practice database creation and deletion:

```sql
-- Create a test database
CREATE DATABASE test_playground;

-- List databases to confirm it exists
\l

-- Drop (delete) the test database
DROP DATABASE test_playground;

-- List databases again to confirm it's gone
\l
```

**Warning:** `DROP DATABASE` permanently deletes a database and all its data. Always double-check the database name before running this command.
